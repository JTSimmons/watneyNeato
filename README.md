Watney is a low-cost Raspberry Pi-enabled rover made of readily available parts. At the heart of it is
Raspberry Pi Zero W powered by a small phone battery bank. Two geared DC motors and an H-bridge controller
provide direct drive to rear wheels and an RPi camera is mounted in the front.
Very little to no soldering required.


Besides the components listed above, some breadboard jumper wires and M3
screws, the rest of the components are 3D-printable.

The software part of Watney provides webcam-on-wheels functionality. The camera feed is low-latency 720p and you control the rover from the browser.
